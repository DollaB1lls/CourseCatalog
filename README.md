This project will eventually be a full stack web application using the MERN stack that utilizes an express server that gets information from
a MongoDB database and displays the courses in a nice table that allows for filter/searching. Results will display in a table and when clicked
will open up to show more details such as a course description and what times they are offered. Eventually want to add a login/signup that allows
users to create a type of schedule by adding the courses to a calender.
